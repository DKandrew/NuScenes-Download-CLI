# NuPlan-Download-CLI


## Usage

```bash
python download_nuplan.py --username <username> --password <password>
wget -i download_links.txt
```

The URLs should be valid for about five days. If you need to download the files again, just run the script again to generate the URLs. Godspeed with the terrabytes of downloads and good luck choking and hogging your entire team's bandwidth.
